**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
The project focused on capturing the user's emotional features by combining textual inputs with facial expression analysis to generate a personalized list of song recommendations. To refine the recommendations further, additional textual attributes, such as the preferred platform, were incorporated. Enhancing user convenience, the system was equipped with a hand gesture-based volume control feature, eliminating the need for physical interaction with the keyboard during music playback. This seamless integration of emotional analysis and gesture-based controls provided a more immersive and user-friendly music experience.
